# 100% Emacs: How to Do Everything In Emacs

A whistle-stop tour on how to do (almost) everything with Emacs.

Working with various different codes in various different languages, along with writing
presentations, talks and papers, I spend most of my day writing text, just with different
syntaxes. As such, I like to be able to do it all in the same program -- and that program
is Emacs. This is a wide-but-shallow introduction on how to work with a multitude of text
and software projects solely using Emacs.
