#+STARTUP: showeverything

* Using magit

** Basic

1. =.M-x load-file.= [[file:customisations/2-magit.el][customisations/2-magit.el]]
2. =.M-x make-directory.= /tmp/test_git (or where you like)
3. =.M-x dired.= (or File > Open directory) the directory you just created
4. =.M-x magit-status.= (=.C-c m.=), the directory should be prompted
5. Say yes
6. Create a file, run =.magit-status.= again
7. See available options with =.?.=
8. Stage file with =.s.=
9. Make a commit with =.c c.=
10. Make some changes to the file
11. Stage a hunk with =.s.=
12. Commit
13. View logs with =.l l.=
14. Make a branch with =.b c.=
15. Make some changes
16. Switch between branches =.b b.=
17. Make some more changes (preferably ones that will conflict with the other branch!)
18. Merge the other branch with =.m m.=
19. Resolve conflicts using ediff with =.e.=


Once you've got the hang of magit, put your .emacs under git:

*** Dired

1. Open the home directory in Dired with =.M-x dired <RET> ~.= or =.C-x d <RET> ~.=
2. Hit =.+.= to create a new directory (I usually use "~/dotfiles")
3. Move the point over ".emacs" and use =.M-x dired-do-rename.= or
   =.R.= to rename it to "~/dotfiles/emacs" (or whatever directory you
   just created)
4. Move to your dotfiles directory with =.<RET>.=, and symlink your
   .emacs back to your home directory with =.M-x dired-do-symlink.= or =.S.=
5. Hit =.^.= to move up a level and check the symlink is correct
6. Open [[~/.emacs]] which should now take you to "~/dotfiles/emacs"
   (assuming you have =.vc-follow-symlinks.= set to =.t.=)
7. Make a new repo, stage and commit the file
8. If you have an account with a git web service, you can make a new
   repo there, and add it as a remote with =.M a.=, then push with =.P p.=

** Advanced

1. Cherry-pick with =.A.= while looking at a commit
2. Rebase interactively with =.r i.=
