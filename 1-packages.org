#+STARTUP: showeverything

* Using packages

** Basic

1. Browse the list of packages =.(package-list-packages).=
2. Find "multiple-cursors" =.C-s multiple-cursors.=
3. Mark the package for installing =.i.= or =.(package-menu-mark-install).=
4. Install marked packages =.x.= or =.(package-menu-execute).=
5. Put the =.use-package.= config for multiple-cursors into your ~/.emacs
   1. (Optional) Change the key-bindings to your personal preference
6. Execute the lisp block =.C-x C-e.=
7. Try out multiple cursors! Open [[file:multiple_cursors.txt][multiple_cursors.text]] and change
   "test" to "function", "int" to "float", and add a semi-colon to the
   end of each line. A couple of notes notes:

   1. =.C-g.= or =.RET.= to leave multiple-cursor mode
   2. Sometimes it will ask you if you want to run a command for all
      cursors. Answer yes or no, and it will remember your choice
      (stored in [[file:~/.emacs.d/.mc-lists.el][~/.emacs.d/.mc_lists.el]] by default)

   Other things to try:

   1. Use =.mc/insert-numbers.= to replace a, b, c, d with 0, 1, 2, 3
   2. Use =.C-j.= or =.C-o.= to insert new lines, and add a simple
      function body

** Advanced

1. Take one of your existing package configurations and convert it to
   =.use-package.= syntax
   1. =.:ensure t.= to make sure the package is installed
   2. =.:init <commands>.= for things that need to be run before
      package is loaded
   3. =.:config <commands>.= for things that need to be run after
      package is loaded
