* Customising Emacs

Customising Emacs can be done in two main ways:

1. Through the ~customize~ interface
2. Directly through elisp

When Emacs starts, it looks for a file [[file:~/.emacs][~/.emacs]] (or "~/.emacs.el",
"~/.emacs.d/init.el") for saved customisations.

See [[info:emacs#Customization][Customization]] in the manual for more info.

** Customize interface

1. Top-level customisations: ~M-x customize~
2. Go to "Environment" then "Frames" and toggle "Tool bar mode"
3. Click "Apply" at the top to apply the settings for just this session

** Elisp

- Emacs core is written in C, but wrapped in elisp (Emacs Lisp)
- Key points about elisp:
  - Functions are written in Polish notation with function name
    first, then arguments: ~+ 1 2~
  - Everything is written in a list: ~(+ 1 2)~
  - Code and data are treated as equals, which means we often need
    to distinguish between symbols and their values: use ~(quote x)~,
    or simply ~'x~
- Elisp can be run from anywhere within Emacs!


1. Open the file [[file:customisations/0-basic.el][customisations/0-basic.el]]
2. Place the point (cursor) after closing brackets on the ~menu-bar-mode~ line
3. Turn off the menu-bar by running the snippet with ~M-x eval-last-sexp~ or ~C-x C-e~
4. Open the file [[file:~/.emacs][~/.emacs]] (or one of the alternatives above) and copy-paste some/all of
   the customisations there
5. Apply the customisations with ~M-x load-file <RET> ~/.emacs~

* Using packages

** Basic

1. Browse the list of packages ~M-x package-list-packages~
2. Find "multiple-cursors" ~C-s multiple-cursors~
3. Mark the package for installing ~i~ or ~M-x package-menu-mark-install~
4. Install marked packages ~x~ or ~M-x package-menu-execute~
5. Put the ~use-package~ config for multiple-cursors into your ~/.emacs
   1. (Optional) Change the key-bindings to your personal preference
6. Execute the lisp block ~C-x C-e~
7. Try out multiple cursors! Open [[file:multiple_cursors.txt][multiple_cursors.text]] and change
   "test" to "function", "int" to "float", and add a semi-colon to the
   end of each line. A couple of notes notes:

   1. ~C-g~ or ~RET~ to leave multiple-cursor mode
   2. Sometimes it will ask you if you want to run a command for all
      cursors. Answer yes or no, and it will remember your choice
      (stored in [[file:~/.emacs.d/.mc-lists.el][~/.emacs.d/.mc_lists.el]] by default)

   Other things to try:

   1. Use ~mc/insert-numbers~ to replace a, b, c, d with 0, 1, 2, 3
   2. Use ~C-j~ or ~C-o~ to insert new lines, and add a simple
      function body

** Advanced

1. Take one of your existing package configurations and convert it to
   ~use-package~ syntax
   1. ~:ensure t~ to make sure the package is installed
   2. ~:init <commands>~ for things that need to be run before
      package is loaded
   3. ~:config <commands>~ for things that need to be run after
      package is loaded
