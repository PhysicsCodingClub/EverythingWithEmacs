* Org mode

** Basics

1. =.load-file.= [[file:customisations/3-org.el][customisations/3-org.el]]
2. Create a new file with the ".org" extension
3. Create a headline called "Tasks". Headlines in org-mode begin with
   one or more asterisks, indicating the level
4. Make a second-level headline under "Tasks" using two asterisks, and
   write a TODO item "Create new org file"
5. Mark the TODO item done with =.org-todo.= (=.C-c C-t.=)
   - Notice how it inserts a time-stamp?
6. Add a few more TODO items with =.org-insert-todo-heading.=
   (=.M-S-RET.=)
7. Create a link using the following syntax:

   : [[link][description]]

   Alternatively, you can use =.org-insert-link.= (=.C-c C-l.=) which
   will prompt you for a link type, link, and description.
8. Open the link with =.org-open-at-point.= (=.C-c C-o.=)
9. Cycle between overviews
10. =.org-export-dispatch.= (=.C-c C-e.=) then "l o" to export to PDF and open
    within Emacs

** Advanced

1. In the =.:config.= section for org-mode, add

   : (setq org-agenda-files (list "~/org/work.org"
   :                              "~/org/home.org"))

2. In the =.:bind.= section add

   : (("C-c a" . org-agenda))
3. Use =.org-agenda.= then =.t.= (=.C-c a t.=) to view all the open
   TODO items in your agenda files
4. Use "t" to mark as DONE, use =.RET.= to jump to source file
5. Move to the line under a TODO item and use =.org-schedule.= (=.C-c
   C-s.=) to set a desired date, and then save
6. Now use =.org-agenda.= then =.a.= (=.C-c a a.=) to get a list of
   scheduled items
