* Org mode

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

You can read the [[info:org][org-mode manual]] with =.M-x org-info.=

** Basics

1. Create a new file with the ".org" extension
2. Create a headline called "Tasks". Headlines in org-mode begin with
   one or more asterisks, indicating the level
3. Make a second-level headline under "Tasks" using two asterisks, and
   write a TODO item "Create new org file"
4. Mark the TODO item done with =.M-x org-todo.= (=.C-c C-t.=)
   - If you'd like time-stamps when you mark something as DONE, set
     =.org-log-done.= to =.'time.= (see [[file:customisations/3-org.el][customisations/3-org.el]])
5. Add a few more TODO items with =.M-x org-insert-todo-heading.=
   (=.M-S-RET.=)
6. Create an ordered list by starting a line with "1." or "1)",
   followed by =.M-<RET>.=. Try writing a list with out-of-order
   numbers, then add a new item with =.M-<RET>.=
7. Create an unordered list by starting a line with "-", "+" or "*"
   - Demote an item into a sublist with =.M-<right>.=
   - Promote with =.M-<left>.=
   - Switch between ordered and unordered lists with =.S-<right>.=
8. Add some check-boxes to the unordered list with "[ ]"
   - [ ] Add some checkboxes
   - [ ] Toggle the boxes with =.C-c C-c.=
   - [0/1] You can make nested check boxes with "[/]"
     - [ ] When you add a checkbox to a sub-item, the "[/]" should
       change to "[0/1]" and update when you check a box
9. Create a link using the following syntax:

   : [[link][description]]

   Alternatively, you can use =.M-x org-insert-link.= (=.C-c C-l.=) which
   will prompt you for a link type, link, and description.
   - You can use =.M-x org-toggle-link-display.= to toggle between
     displaying the markup or the hyperlink
10. Open the link with =.M-x org-open-at-point.= (=.C-c C-o.=)
11. Cycle between overviews
12. =.M-x org-export-dispatch.= (=.C-c C-e.=) then "l o" to export to PDF and open
    within Emacs

** Advanced

1. In the =.:config.= section for org-mode, add org files to be used
   for your agenda like so:

   : (setq org-agenda-files (list "~/org/work.org"
   :                              "~/org/home.org"))

2. In the =.:bind.= section bind a key to =.org-agenda.=:

   : (("C-c a" . org-agenda))
3. Use =.M-x org-agenda.= then =.t.= (=.C-c a t.=) to view all the open
   TODO items in your agenda files
4. Use =.t.= to mark as DONE, use =.RET.= to jump to source file
5. Move to the line under a TODO item and use =.M-x org-schedule.= (=.C-c
   C-s.=) to set a desired date, and then save
6. Now use =.M-x org-agenda.= then =.a.= (=.C-c a a.=) to get a list of
   scheduled items
