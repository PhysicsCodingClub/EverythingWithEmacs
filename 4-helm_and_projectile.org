* Helm and projectile

** Helm

Helm is an incremental completion framework that allows you to quickly find what you're
looking for, as well execute commands on multiple candidates. One of the big features is
out of order matching using regular expressions.

1. Open [[file:customisations/4-helm-projectile.el][customisations/4-helm-projectile.el]] and eval the ~helm~ config
2. Hit ~M-x~. This starts a helm session with your command history
3. Type "rect op" -- notice how it narrows down the candidates as you
   type
4. Use ~C-n~ and ~C-p~ to browse the list of candidates
5. Hit ~<TAB>~ with a function highlighted to see the help for that
   function
6. Completion with helm
   1. Careful with tab-complete!
