* Helm and projectile

** Helm

Helm is an incremental completion framework that allows you to quickly find what
you're looking for, as well execute commands on multiple candidates. One of the
big features is out of order matching using regular expressions.

Basic usage:
- Type parts of what you're looking for
- Helm will search for candidates, sorting them by best match
- Keep typing till the correct result is highlighted
  - Alternatively, use ~C-n~ to navigate to it
- Hit ~<RET>~ to select the currently highlighted candidate

If you're used to ~<TAB>~ completion in Emacs, careful! As Helm automatically
highlights the best match, ~<TAB>~ completion is not needed, and in this
tutorial is instead bound to run a default action.

1. Open [[file:customisations/4-helm-projectile.el][customisations/4-helm-projectile.el]] and eval the ~helm~ config
   - This reassigns some default functions to use Helm ones instead, as well as
     try and make the interface a little prettier
2. Hit ~M-x~. This starts a helm session with your command history
3. Type "op re" -- notice how it narrows down the candidates as you type
   - ~open-rectangle~ should now be at the top
4. Now try "re ^op" -- ~open-rectangle~ should now be the only candidate
   - Notice how it shows the key binding right next to the function?
5. Hit ~<TAB>~ with ~open-rectangle~ highlighted to see the help for that
   function
   - Press ~<TAB>~ again to close the help window
6. Use ~M-y~ to view the kill ring
   - Normally, ~M-y~ must be used immediately after ~C-y~ (~yank~), but
     ~helm-show-kill-ring~ can be used at any time
7. As well as typing patterns, you can use ~C-n~ and ~C-p~ to browse the list of
   candidates
8. ~C-x b~ now opens ~helm-mini~ instead of ~switch-to-buffer~
   - As well as your open buffers, Helm also shows recently opened files, and
     allows you to create a new empty buffer
   - Filter by directory with "/<directory>", e.g. "/customisations" to show
     buffers in the customisations directory
   - Filter by mode with "*<mode>", e.g. "*org" to show org-mode buffers
   - Filter by contents with "@<regexp>", e.g. "@cats" to show buffers
     containing the string "cats"
9. ~C-x f~ now opens ~helm-find-files~
10. Use ~C-s~ from within a ~helm-find-files~ session to grep selected files
