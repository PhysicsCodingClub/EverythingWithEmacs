#+STARTUP: showeverything

* C/C++/Fortran like languages

** Basic

1. Movement across blocks:
   1. ~C-M-f~ and ~C-M-b~ to jump *forward* and *backward* over
      matching brackets
   2. ~C-M-a~ and ~C-M-e~ to jump to the beginning and end of a function
2. ~comment-dwim~ (~M-;~, "do what I mean") to add a comment
   - With a region selected, comment out region (or uncomment)
3. ~shell~ then ~make tags~
4. Jump between definitions with ~xref-find-definitions~ (~M-.~)
5. Jump between references with ~xref-find-references~ (~M-?~)
6. Jump back to where you were with ~xref-pop-marker-stack~ (~M-,~)
7. Jump between source and header with ~helm-projectile-find-other-file~ (~C-c p a~)
8. Compile with ~projectile-compile-project~ (~C-c p c~)
9. Run tests with ~projectile-test-project~ (~C-c p P~)
10. Enable ~flycheck-mode~ for basic syntax checking using the compiler
11. Enable ~company-mode~ for more advanced completion
12. After editing, use ~whitespace-cleanup~ to remove trailing whitespace
    1. For C-like languages, you can also use ~clang-format-buffer~

** Advanced

1. Launch the gdb debugger with ~gdb~
   1. When it asks you how to run gdb, use
      ~gdb -i=mi --fullname ~/emacs/EverythingWithEmacs/c/hello~
2. Choose a line in the code and insert a breakpoint with
   ~gud-break~ (~C-x C-a C-b~)
3. ~run~ the program until it reaches the breakpoint, then ~step~
   through the code
4. You can ~print~ local values of variables
